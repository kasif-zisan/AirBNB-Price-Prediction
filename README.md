# NYC AirBNB Price Prediction model
This project was created as part of the course 'CSE475: Machine Learning'.

## Project Overview
This project involves the prediction of prices for various Airbnb listings in New York City, using the 'New York City Airbnb Open Data' dataset. To accomplish this task, we employ an array of regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. We then evaluate the models using key evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) score and then compare the results. Furthermore, to enhance the interpretability of our models, we integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as Feature Importance, Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This study aims to provide accurate predictions while enhancing the interpretability of the underlying factors influencing Airbnb property prices. 

To increase the user interaction of the model, we created a WebApp using Streamlit so that users can predict AirBNB prices by just inputting some input feature values. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information about Airbnb listings in New York City, including features such as neighborhood group, room type, minimum nights, number of reviews, and more.
